 I am an enthusiastic learner in cloud and network engineering with a strong interest in Google Cloud. I'm dedicated to building a solid understanding of cloud services and network engineering as I work through various learning projects.

- üéì Currently working on my first projects using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to get hands-on experience with services like Cloud Storage, BigQuery, and App Engine.
- üõ†Ô∏è Interested in network security, cloud automation, and data processing as I grow my skill set.
- ü§ù Looking for opportunities to collaborate with others on beginner-to-intermediate cloud projects to learn together!

## Objective

Throughout my journey in Network Engineering, I've developed a strong understanding of how networks function and the importance of maintaining reliable systems. As I've gained experience, I‚Äôve found myself increasingly drawn to cloud computing and DevOps. The ability to integrate development and operations to streamline processes and foster collaboration excites me. I‚Äôm now ready to transition into the DevOps field and be part of a team where I can apply my network skills, learn new technologies, and help deploy and manage cloud-based solutions effectively.
