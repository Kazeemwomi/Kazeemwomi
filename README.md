## Objective

Throughout my journey in Network Engineering, I've developed a strong understanding of how networks function and the importance of maintaining reliable systems. As I've gained experience, I‚Äôve found myself increasingly drawn to cloud computing and DevOps. The ability to integrate development and operations to streamline processes and foster collaboration excites me. I‚Äôm now ready to transition into the DevOps field and be part of a team where I can apply my network skills, learn new technologies, and help deploy and manage cloud-based solutions effectively.
